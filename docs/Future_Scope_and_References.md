- **Personalization & Adaptive Programs**
  - Preference-aware content, streak coaching, and phased CBT/mindfulness plans based on engagement.
- **Safety Enhancements**
  - Expanded crisis heuristics, configurable escalation rules, and real-time risk prompts with user consent.
- **Clinician/Coach Companion (Opt-in, Privacy-First)**
  - Read-only trend summaries and shared exercise plans with explicit user control and consent.
- **Evidence Packs & RAG**
  - Curated, versioned content packs with retrieval-augmented responses for psychoeducation and exercises.
- **Biometric/Biofeedback Integrations (Optional)**
  - Wearable data (HRV, sleep) to personalize guidance; strict opt-in and local processing where possible.
- **Institutional Deployments**
  - NGO/school pilots with privacy-preserving analytics dashboards and exportable reports.
- **Accessibility First**
  - WCAG 2.2 AA, voice input/output, large-text themes, and cognitive-friendly flows.

## Conclusion
Neeva AI focuses on empathetic, safe, and practical support for youth mental wellness. By combining a companion-style AI, low-friction mood tracking, and guided exercises with clear safety boundaries, Neeva lowers barriers to daily self-care and early help-seeking. The modular architecture enables responsible expansion—multilingual support, institutional pilots, and biofeedback—without compromising privacy or trust. Continued collaboration with mental health professionals, NGOs, and communities in India will refine Neeva’s cultural relevance and impact.
